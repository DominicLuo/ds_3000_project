# DS_3000_FinalProject 

This project examines data from the Fortune Global 500 to uncover factors influencing business proficiency and profitability. We attempt to derive correlation between gender identities of leaders, employee count, financial growth and business efficiency to help prove this hypothesis.

We have implemented 2 machine learning models on different subsets of variables in our dataset to help prove the hyposthesis. One being a Linear Regression, drawing connections between number of employees and revenue generation across companies, while the other being a Random Forest model, determining whether or not gender of companies leader is an important factor impacting financial health.
